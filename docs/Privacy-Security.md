# Privacy & Security (Prototype)

## Consent

- Explicit consent before microphone capture.
- Visible “recording on” indicator during capture.

## Data retention

- Configurable retention for transcripts (default: short).
- Avoid storing raw audio for prototype unless required for debugging.

## Browsing / external calls

- “No-browse mode”: restrict research tools to approved sources or disable external fetching.
- Log tool usage for transparency (which sources were queried).

## Safety expectations

- Do not present uncited data as factual.
- Clearly label assumptions and inferred context.
